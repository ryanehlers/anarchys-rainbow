        <h2>Notes on Oasis — <em>Supersonic</em></h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The format of these notes is derived from Alan W. Pollack’s <a href="http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/awp-a.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Notes on The Beatles</em></a>, which I won’t deviate from too much because “ain’t broke…” etc. I’m going to be writing about Oasis, writing as much about the music itself as possible, instead of things like history, context and lyrics that music writers often get distracted by. (I’m not against it, just everyone else is already doing it.) I’ll try to introduce musical jargon as I go, but you’ll probably at least have to be able to strum a few guitar chords to follow everything I say.</p>
        <p>If I’ve got the motivation it’d be nice to at least do every song in <em>Definitely Maybe</em>, and if that’s enjoyable enough (for me to write, or anybody else to read!) maybe stretch to <em>Morning Glory</em> and b-sides.</p>
        <p>I’m starting with <em>Supersonic</em> because it’s the first single, it’s a great song, and there’s a lot to say about it. I’m gonna talk about scales and stuff and of course Noel isn’t thinking about them as he writes, but the fact is that there are names for what the band are doing and reasons they have certain effects, so I’m just gonna call them what they are.</p>

        <p><em>Supersonic</em> was Oasis’s first single, written and recorded on 19 December 1993 and released 11 April 1994. The recording session was intended to be for a different single, <em>Bring it on Down</em>, but supposedly it wasn’t going well so while the rest of the band had a break to eat dinner Noel wrote <em>Supersonic</em>.</p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The structure basically reduces to — verse | chorus | solo | (repeat) — with each verse split AAB into two verses and a bridge, and the solos as an outgrowth of the chorus. By AAB I mean, two identical sections “A” and then a new one “B”.</li>
          <li>The arrangement hardly changes at all on the repeat. I’m hesitant to quote Thatcher in this context, and I disagree with almost everything she did, but supposedly she was asked if she would have done anything differently given the chance and she answered, “I think I did pretty well the first time.” The confidence of the pure repetition reminds me of that confidence.</li>
          <li>This structure — basically two verses and two choruses and no unique middle part — is quite distinctive and it’s probably fair to say it’s Noel’s favourite song structure, at least until <em>Be Here Now</em>. Usually in a mainstream pop or rock song you expect 3 or 4 choruses and a unique middle part, and folk song usually has 3 or 4 choruses but might not have a unique middle part.</li>
          <li>Often in this structure Noel includes a separate repetitive mantra as part of the outro (e.g. <em>Slide Away</em>). <em>Supersonic</em>’s an outlier in that it doesn’t have one. This might be just because it was written and recorded so quickly.</li>
          <li>Other examples of the two verse/two chorus structure are: <em>Columbia</em>, <em>Cigarettes and Alcohol</em>, <em>Slide Away</em>, <em>Hello</em>, <em>Wonderwall</em> (ish), <em>Some Might Say</em>, <em>Cast No Shadow</em>, <em>She’s Electric</em>, <em>Morning Glory</em>, <em>Acquiesce</em>, <em>Half the World Away</em>, <em>The Masterplan</em> (etc., I could keep going!)</li>
          <li>For all the talk of the influence of The Beatles, they almost never use this structure — except notably <em>You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away</em>, which must have been one of Oasis’s favourites because they covered it for one of the b-sides on <em>Some Might Say</em>.</li>
          <li>I suspect Noel actually takes this structure from The Smiths, especially <em>There is a Light…</em> which is probably his idea of the perfect pop song. <em>There is a Light</em> also has one of these closing mantras. Morrissey uses them all the time.</li>
          <li>But he might also have in mind something like <em>Life on Mars</em> by Bowie or <em>Heart of Gold</em> by Neil Young.</li>
          <li>There are some Beatles-y touches and a lift from My Sweet Lord but, despite the nod to <em>Yellow Submarine</em> in the lyrics (and also maybe <em>Waterfall</em> by The Stone Roses), it seems to me overall more influenced by Neil Young. Something like the lovechild of <em>Heart of Gold</em> and <em>Cinnamon Girl</em>. Talking about him in an interview Noel said, “[Neil Young] is the only guy I’ve been in awe of after meeting… I’ve seen him with Crazy Horse, with acoustic gigs, and he always comes from a place of truth.”</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The intro is 12 bars, split into two parts. The first part is 4 bars of drums, the second is 8 bars — 4 repeats — of the riff. 8 bars is the same length as one of the verses. In general Noel loves 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s. (There are two main units of time in music, beats and bars. Usually in pop/rock songs a bar is 4 beats.)</li>
          <li>The song starts with a simple, hypnotic 4/4 drumbeat that stays pretty much constant throughout.</li>
          <li>The effect of the intro is to create tension so that the first verse lands as an immediate rush, like a chorus.</li>
          <li>In the <em>Definitely Maybe</em> documentary Gem Archer, who joined the band later, describes the tempo as always just a bit too slow, “like trying to walk in the swimming pool”. This is how a confident performer controls the energy in the room: always a bit too slow or a bit too fast compared to how the nervous amateur in the audience would have done it. Think of a commanding performance from an Olympic diver who takes exactly as long as they need to steady themselves, and dives out of the pause. The perfect example of this in a pop song is <em>Feeling Good</em> by Nina Simone.</li>
          <li>From starting with just the drums, a listener is immediately anticipating the rest of the band coming in. Often in music you think of tension and resolution in terms of the progress of the harmony and the melody, but in some ways creating tension is about how what is played exaggerates the silence of the resolution we’re expecting. So the drums create tension without any harmony or melody at all.</li>
          <li>The chord progression implied by the riff is</li>
        </ul>
        <p>| f# | A B⁷ | × 4</p>
        <p>| i | bIII IV⁷ |</p>
        <p>(Lowercase = minor chord, uppercase = major chord. The Roman numeral is the place of the root on the scale: i = first note on the scale, bIII = “flattened” (minor) third note on the scale. The key itself isn’t that important, just the movements relative to the key, like playing the same song with the capo in different positions. By taking the key out, the numerals make the movements clearer.)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The chord change from A to B7 is “syncopated” — it happens between beats. This gives the riff a driving groove, pushed along by a slight feeling of instability. This is common trick in chordal riffs in rock ’n’ roll (e.g. <em>Twist and Shout</em>).</li>
          <li>When the guitar comes in it creates a lot of energy with the riff but the chords still feel a bit unstable because Noel leaves the top two strings on the F#m chord ringing open. If he were playing without overdrive it would sound a little jazzy. On live versions Noel often plays a properly jazzy B¹¹.</li>
          <li>The standard (“diatonic”) F#m scale has a D in it, which would make a B minor chord (iv) instead of a B major (IV). The major chord is “borrowed” from the parallel key of F# major, giving the progression its slightly triumphant mood.</li>
          <li>The point at which a chord sequence resolves is called a cadence. The typical “authentic” cadence goes V — I or V — i (in F#m that’d be C# — f#). It’s quite a dramatic, classical sound that announces you’ve arrived home. A V chord includes the seventh degree of the scale, the note which is just one semitone down from from the root (in F#m that note is F). So the V chord sounds very unstable and your ear expects the note to move up to the root for resolution. You feel this as a kind of magnetic pull to the home chord. A really clear example of a V — I cadence is between the bridge and the verse in <em>Twist and Shout</em>. The long “Aah…” is the unstable V chord being pulled and resolved into the I chord at “Baby now…”</li>
          <li>The cadence here is the less dramatic “plagal” cadence which goes IV — i (B — f#). A plagal cadence doesn’t have the same magnetic pull as an authentic cadence because it hasn’t got the seventh degree of the scale. The cadence basically comes to rock ’n’ roll via the 12-bar blues and in this song it’s got a less sentimental but more forceful quality.</li>
          <li>The bass and the rhythm guitar stay silent in the intro so that the verse lands with full force.</li>
          <li>Also the pick scratching starting in the 4th bar just before the riff comes in and continuing through the riff: building up for the verse, Noel’s literally scratching and stretching out the tension in the guitar strings.</li>
          <li>The chords are kept the same in the verses but the riff itself only appears in the intro.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Verse</h3>
        <p><em>Be myself...</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The verse keeps the same implied chord progression as the intro, though Bonehead now plays it explicitly as power chords, keeping the syncopation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>| f# | A B | × 4</p>
        <p>| i | bIII IV |</p>
        <ul>
          <li>McCarroll keeps the same beat from the intro with just a cymbal crash on the first beat of each new verse to mark the division.</li>
          <li>Guigsy’s bass part just doubles up the root note of the chords that Bonehead is playing. This extra octave on the bottom makes the chords sound bigger.</li>
          <li>The verse melody, along with Noel’s first little lead lick, actually starts a couple of beats before the verse section starts properly and Bonehead and Guigsy come in. This is similar to the dramatic “walking in the swimming pool” effect: we’ll start when we’re good and ready, and not a moment sooner.</li>
          <li>The melody in the verse is over a range of just a fifth, F# to C# and leaves a lot of spaces for Noel’s lead guitar parts.</li>
          <li>The verse melody sticks to a pentatonic scale. The pentatonic scale is everywhere in rock music (e.g. The Rolling Stones, Neil Young) — both in vocal melodies and instrumental parts, and Noel loves it.</li>
          <li>There are 5 notes in the pentatonic scale (pent- as in pentagon) compared to 7 in a regular major or minor scale. The two notes that are dropped are the two that are only one semitone (note interval) away from the notes that are in the root chord. An F#m chord has the notes F# A C# so the notes which are dropped from the scale are G# (one semitone down from A) and D (one semitone up from C#).</li>
          <li>In a melody, one semitone intervals tend to sound a bit soft and fragile. By avoiding them you can make something that sounds both melodic and robust. Along with its simplicity, this is why it’s so popular in rock, and it makes the most out of a singer like Liam.</li>
          <li>There are essentially two different 2-bar melodic phrases in the verse, on “I need to be myself” (A) and “I’m feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic” (B). They’re arranged AABB so the whole verse melody is 4 × 2 = 8 bars.</li>
          <li>There are two simple melodic lead guitar fills in the verses, used in alternation after each vocal phrase as a kind of call and response. One in the range just below the vocal, and one just above it. This choreography means that the vocal and the lead guitar part build on each other without needing to compete for attention.</li>
          <li>The lead parts are not exactly, but pretty much, arpeggios (that is, picking out notes from the chord one at a time).</li>
          <li>The alternation creates a kind of patchwork weave effect between the voice and the guitar where, staying inside a small number of simple patterns, each combined voice + guitar phrase is unique, and the verse consists of Liam and Noel going back and forth to fill out all 4 possible combinations. I think this effect is more often used in dance music than rock, to make interesting patterns out of small, simple, repeating parts.</li>
          <li>If we call the lead guitar phrases c and d, the overall phrasing is going AcAdBcBd.</li>
          <li>I doubt it’s intentional but Noel’s habit of splitting everything into two similar repeats gives the song a pretty deep fractal structure. Each verse melody phrase is doubled up (i.e. the AABB I’m talking about above). Then each full 16-bar verse is made up of two identical half-verses: “I need to be myself…” matches “You make me laugh…” The solo and outro mirror the choruses (see below) and as mentioned already in the structure section, the top-level structure of the song also splits symmetrically right down the middle into two repeating sections: verse | chorus | solo | (repeat).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bridge</h3>
        <p><em>Find out, ’cause no one’s gonna tell you…</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The bridge introduces some new chords:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>| E | — | f# | — | E | — | C#⁷ | — |</p>
        <p>| bVII | — | i | — | bVII | — | V | — |</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The E chord (bVII) introduces the new section clearly with a change of mood, because the chord isn’t used anywhere in the verse.</li>
          <li>Because the chords are only changing every 2 bars and the changes aren’t syncopated, the bridge has a feeling of the momentum of the song slowing a bit, the calm before the storm of the chorus.</li>
          <li>The drumbeat matches the verse, with just a cymbal crash on its first beat to introduce the bridge.</li>
          <li>The bass keeps on doubling up the root of the guitar chords.</li>
          <li>The lead guitar part continues in the vein of the verse, playing arpeggios in the breaks between phrases on the lead vocal.</li>
          <li>The other big change in softening the texture from the verse is Noel’s Revolver-y backing vocal.</li>
          <li>The melody in the bridge is over a range of a major seventh, from F# up to the F above.</li>
          <li>There aren’t any fully repeated melodic phrases in the bridge, though the two phrases over the E chords are quite closely related; each phrase is somewhat unique. However the melody that goes with “on about” is a callback, a direct repeat of the melody to “be myself” from the verse, over the same chord.</li>
          <li>The scale of the melody changes from pentatonic minor to harmonic minor. The harmonic minor is a bit softer, more dramatic and classical sounding. The most important difference here is that it pushes the flattened seventh (E) up to a natural seventh (F). This natural seventh sounds unstable because it’s only one semitone from the root F#, creating the magnetic pull into the chorus.</li>
          <li>As well as in Liam’s vocal (“be-<b>fore</b> tomorrow…”) the F is also used in the lead guitar part and the backing vocal so you can’t miss it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p><em>My friend said, he'd take you home</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The chords go:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>| D A | E f# | × 4</p>
        <p>|bVI bIII | bVII i |</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Like the E chord at the start of the bridge, the D chord at the start of the chorus doesn’t appear anywhere in the verse or the bridge so it marks a significant change of mood.</li>
          <li>In general in a minor key, moving to the bVI chord tends to give the mood a lift. The effect is like turning on the lights in a dark room. The clever thing about how it’s used in <em>Supersonic</em> isn’t really that it’s used, everyone uses it, but that it’s held back until the chorus. A good case of less is more.</li>
          <li>The dramatic move from the V chord (C#) at the end of the bridge the semitone up to the bVI (D) at the start of the chorus is harmonically the cleverest and most unusual part of the song and probably the moment that makes it.</li>
          <li>The movement of everything going up a semitone in parallel gives you the same kind of energy as you get when a Whitney Houston song does a key change to move up everything in parallel for the last chorus, but without the cheesy effect of actually changing the key.</li>
          <li>Although D is not the I chord, it still lands with a big sense of arrival and inevitability, as if we’d had a V — I cadence. There are two basically equivalent ways of thinking about why this is. The first is that a D chord is only one note from being an f#, and C# — f# would be a V — i cadence. The other is that C# is heard as a substitute for an A chord because A would also have a C#. C# is the seventh of the D and in the key of D major A — D would be a V — I cadence.</li>
          <li>The most distinctive feature of the chord sequence chorus is the consecutive moves to the fifth. By which I mean, part of the sequence goes D — A — E, A is the fifth of D and E is the fifth of A. The move to the fifth is a kind of plagal cadence (i.e. if we were in the key of A, D — A would be a IV — I plagal cadence). This gets called a “double plagal” cadence. A double plagal cadence has a very anthemic sound — it’s the core of the “Na na na…” bit in <em>Hey Jude</em> — and the list of Oasis songs that don’t use it somewhere is probably shorter than the list that do.</li>
          <li>The chorus has a faster rate of chord changes than the verse or the bridge. The acceleration is particularly in contrast to the bridge that precedes it; the chorus fits 4 chords into 2 bars, whereas the bridge only fits in 1.</li>
          <li>Like in the verse, the second chord change in each bar (to A and f#) is syncopated.</li>
          <li>Again the drumbeat matches the verse and the section is introduced by a cymbal crash, but Liam also plays the tambourine which fills out the texture of the percussion and gives it a slight feeling of double-time.</li>
          <li>Bonehead is still playing power chords and Guigsy is still doubling them up at the root.</li>
          <li>Noel’s backing vocal drops out from the bridge.</li>
          <li>If you mark the solo as starting when the guitar comes in, chorus + solo breaks up as 8 bars + 8 bars. If you mark the solo as starting when the singing stops, then chorus + solo is 10 + 6. I’ve marked it 8 + 8 to make the symmetry as clear as possible, but that does leave the second “Nobody can ever hear him…” overhanging into what I’ve called the solo.</li>
          <li>The melody is over a range of a ninth, from E up to the F# the octave above. It’s on a gradual downward arc, pulling from the top F# down to the bottom one.</li>
          <li>It starts on a big interval leap of a sixth, from A (“’cause”) up to F# (“my”) before mostly descending stepwise down the pentatonic scale.</li>
          <li>The melody is made of two similar 2-bar phrases which I’ll call A (“My friend said…”) and A’ (“He sits in the corner…”), and two similar 1-bar phrases which I’ll call B and B’.</li>
          <li>They’re arranged AA’ABB’. (If you add in the extra bit from what I’ve called the solo, AA’ABB’B’.)</li>
          <li>A and A’ have identical starts but finish differently; A makes a bit of an arc but A’ keeps descending down to the bottom F# on “alone”. B’ is identical to B, except that it tags an extra few notes on the end (“hear him call.”)</li>
          <li>Instead of playing call and response licks in the gaps in the vocal melody, Noel plays 4 repeats of a 2-bar melodic riff in parallel with the vocal melody.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solo</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>First time around, the chords mirror the chorus, followed by a 4-bar interlude that sets up the next verse:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>| D A | E f# | × 4 … | E | — | C#⁷ | — |</p>
        <p>|bVI bIII | bVII i | … | bVII | — | V | — |</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The melody for the solo is made up of two alternating 2-bar phrases, repeated twice each: ABAB. The B phrase has the same start as the A phrase but a different ending.</li>
          <li>The way the start of the solo is weaved into the end of the chorus is set up by the more subtle voice + guitar weaving effect in the verse. It even matches the pattern, in that the vocal part (“Nobody can ever hear…”) is repeated exactly while the guitar part alternates.</li>
          <li>There’s also a larger structural sense in which the whole solo is heard as an overall block response to the call of the chorus.</li>
          <li>The melody sticks to the f# pentatonic scale.</li>
          <li>The role of a good instrumental solo part in a pop/rock song is to lift the song to place that it couldn’t get to with just words, at the point where words fail. There’s something delicious about launching the solo off the words “Nobody can ever hear him call.”</li>
          <li>Tagged onto the end of the first solo is a condensed instrumental version of the bridge, and the backing vocal makes a reappearance. From the end of the solo into the start of the following verse is the only time there’s a full V — i cadence, though in live versions they also finish the song this way.</li>
          <li>The second solo runs for about 30 or 40 bars over the fadeout. It starts out jamming on the same theme from the first solo but as it progresses Noel moves away from it to some less melodic, almost percussive licks and adds another guitar overdub, also jamming in the same range on f# minor pentatonic.</li>
          <li>At the same time, as the solo progresses, they throw in some handclaps to quite a danceable rhythm on the backbeat and turn up the tambourine.</li>
          <li>As the fadeout concludes Noel moves back home to the original solo theme.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some Concluding Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I’ve mostly avoided talking about the lyrics but I can’t resist saying a little about the word supersonic.</li>
          <li>Songs to me are largely about putting together words and sounds to get in at a deep, instinctive place where words and thinking by themselves can’t go.</li>
          <li>So you always have this sense of going beyond words, but supersonic means, <em>beyond <b>sound</b></em>. Either by accident or by genius, “Nobody can ever hear him call” carries this same thing of being beyond sound into the chorus. Noel must have known it’s a good concluding line, because it’s the only line that gets repeated more than twice.</li>
          <li>So what does it mean to call a song <em>Supersonic</em>? To me it’s about the euphoric spirit that goes with music. The euphoria isn’t really in the sound itself, it’s in what happens when you give the sound to people, and how they respond to it. It’s something like the euphoria of how everyone comes together for the music. Shades of Barcelona’s <em>més que un club</em>.</li>
          <li>Whatever it means, it’s a hell of a name for a first single: “It’s sound, Jim, but not as we know it.”</li>
        </ul>
