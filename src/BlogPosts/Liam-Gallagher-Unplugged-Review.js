        <h2>Review: <em>MTV Unplugged (Live At Hull City Hall)</em>, Liam Gallagher</h2>
        <p>I cried, the first time I heard a live performance of <em>Once</em>. And the second. And the third. And the fourth…</p>
        <p>It took me a long time to understand why the song made me so emotional. It’s good enough, but no one is going to pretend it’s in the same league as <em>Live Forever</em>, <em>Champagne Supernova</em>, or even <em>Stand By Me</em>. However, there’s no denying the electricity of the performances, and for the first time in over 20 years Liam’s is recognisably the voice of the genius who sang <em>Definitely Maybe</em>. While I cried I kept thinking, “He’s back. I can’t believe he’s really back.”</p>
        <p>Why does it matter so much to me that a man I’m never going to meet can sing well again? Even at their peak Oasis were a flawed band, and when someone doesn’t understand them – frankly, even when they do – it’s difficult to explain their transcendent significance.</p>
        <p>For most of my life, and certainly as a child, nobody told me – explicitly or implicitly – that I could make anything beautiful. This is true for a lot of people, certainly for most working class and middle class men. I only realise now, that when children are subtly given the message that they can’t, never will be able to, and shouldn’t want to sing, dance, draw, paint, tell stories, etc., this is a similar lie to telling a child the same thing about reading. It’s not that everyone is going to be able to paint like Raphael, or sing like Michael Jackson. The point is that you shouldn’t feel you have to be a genius with 20 years of experience before you can share something you made without being embarrassed, and before you can enjoy creating it. (For what it’s worth, I still draw like a 6-year-old and I’m ashamed to try.)</p>
        <p>My aesthetic sensitivity was so numbed that until I was at least 24 I almost never even spoke or thought the word “beautiful”, whether about a woman, a song, a goal in a football match, or anything else. I never enjoyed a novel until I was 20; I never enjoyed a poem until I was 21; I never enjoyed visual art or looking at nature until I was 24 (frankly, after I took LSD). It’s not that I was suddenly able to enjoy these things because I became more mature. It’s just that I’d somehow been trained to believe these things weren’t for me, and no one had been able to show me a doorway in.</p>
        <p>Just as Bob Dylan did for Bruce Springsteen, Oasis kicked open the doorway of my mind. I started listening when I was 15. Then I watched videos of old gigs and everyone – <em>everyone</em> – was singing each word at the top of their lungs. Until then I didn’t even really know what a gig was. The energy of it literally blew my mind.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, what happened is that while I was growing up my voice was robbed, and Oasis gave it back ("<em>While we're living, the dreams we have as children…</em>"). Or really, my voice was pushed down so hard I didn’t even know I had one; and when I heard Oasis I realised those songs were in my voice. As the rapper Akala puts it, “I don’t speak for myself but a unit.” This is why everyone at an Oasis gig sings so loudly. This is why all the burly men are sobbing like England just lost on penalties at the World Cup.</p>
        <p>I got my first guitar when I was 16, because I had to learn how to play <em>Supersonic</em> and <em>Live Forever</em>. I didn’t have any free will about it. I couldn’t not. Not everyone can paint like Raphael or sing like Michael Jackson, but everyone can sing along to an Oasis song and play guitar like Noel Gallagher and Bonehead. That’s the whole point. If you’re reading this and you’ve wanted to play guitar, but you doubted you could do it: you can do it, I promise you. If you cared enough to find and read this piece you already have all the determination you need. If you feel like you had the opportunity in the past but you missed it: don’t worry, the best opportunity is right now. It’s always right now.</p>
        <p>Hearing Liam sing so well again, it’s the renewal of that first time anyone showed me I had a voice.</p>
        <p>He’s back. I can’t believe he’s really back.</p>
